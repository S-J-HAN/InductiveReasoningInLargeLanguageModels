We're going to show you a series of claims relating to living things and the properties they share. Rather than mention any specific property (e.g. ""Hyenas have sesamoid bones"") we'll refer to an unspecified property (e.g. ""Hyenas have property P""). Each claim may be true or false, and to help you decide which, we'll provide you with facts about whether or not other living things have the same property (e.g. ""Lions have property P"", and ""Zebras have property P"").

This section contains a series of claims that include two supporting facts. Before we start, we'll give you two examples as practice.

Argument A:
Fact - Lemons have property P.
Fact - Limes have property P.
Claim - All fruits have property P.

Question: Given the facts presented, how likely is it that the claim is true? Indicate your answer by providing a number between 0 and 100, where 0 means that the claim is very unlikely and 100 means that the claim is very likely.

The questions you'll see don't have right or wrong answers, and you are willing to use your best judgment and commit to a concrete, specific response even in cases where you can't be sure that you are correct.

We're going to show you a series of claims relating to living things and the properties they share. Rather than mention any specific property (e.g. ""Hyenas have sesamoid bones"") we'll refer to an unspecified property (e.g. ""Hyenas have property P""). Each claim may be true or false, and to help you decide which, we'll provide you with facts about whether or not other living things have the same property (e.g. ""Lions have property P"", and ""Zebras have property P"").

This section contains a series of claims that include only one supporting fact. Before we start, we'll give you two examples as practice.

Claim - Raspberries have property P.

Question: Given the facts presented, how likely is it that the claim is true? Indicate your answer by providing a number between 0 and 100, where 0 means that the claim is very unlikely and 100 means that the claim is very likely.

Each claim may be true or false, and to help you decide which, we'll provide you with facts about whether or not other objects have the same property (e.g. ""Lions have property P"", and ""Zebras have property P"").

This section contains a series of claims that include two supporting facts. Before we start, we'll give you two examples as practice.

Question: Given the facts presented, how likely is it that the claim is true? Indicate your answer by providing a number between 0 and 100, where 0 means that the claim is very unlikely and 100 means that the claim is very likely.

Rather than mention any specific property (e.g. ""Hyenas have sesamoid bones"") we'll refer to an unspecified property (e.g. ""Hyenas have property P""). Each claim may be true or false, and to help you decide which, we'll provide you with facts about whether or not other objects have the same property (e.g. ""Lions have property P"", and ""Zebras have property P"").

This section contains a series of claims that include two supporting facts. Before we start, we'll give you two examples as practice.

We're going to show you a series of claims relating to living things and the properties they share. Rather than mention any specific property (e.g. ""Hyenas have sesamoid bones"") we'll refer to an unspecified property (e.g. ""Hyenas have property P""). Each claim may be true or false, and to help you decide which, we'll provide you with facts about whether or not other living things have the same property (e.g. ""Lions have property P"", and ""Zebras have property P"").

This section contains a series of claims that include only one supporting fact. Before we start, we'll give you two examples as practice.

Claim - Raspberries have property P.

Question: Given the facts presented, how likely is it that the claim is true? Indicate your answer by providing a number between 0 and 100, where 0 means that the claim is very unlikely and 100 means that the claim is very likely.
