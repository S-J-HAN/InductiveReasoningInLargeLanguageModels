Argument A only provides one fact about a single species having property P and makes a claim about another species having the same property based on that. This is not a strong enough basis to make a likely claim.

Argument A provides evidence that two different types of animals (horses and bats) have property P, which makes it more likely that cats also have property P. However, it is possible that cats are an exception and do not have property P, despite horses and bats having it. Therefore, Argument A is only slightly more likely than Argument B.

Argument B provides evidence that horses and llamas have property P, which is less direct evidence than Argument A. However, the fact that llamas also have property P suggests that it may be a more common property among different types of animals. Therefore, Argument B is also only slightly more likely than Argument A.
