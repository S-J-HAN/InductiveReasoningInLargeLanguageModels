Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:
Fact - Bicycles have property P.
Claim - Rockets have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Bicycles have property P.
Claim - All vehicles have property P.

Question: Assuming all the facts given are true, which argument makes a stronger case for the claim? To get the best answer, first write down your reasoning. Then, based on this, indicate your preference by providing one of the following options:

Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:
Fact - Mopeds have property P.
Claim - Bicycles have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Airplanes have property P.
Claim - Bicycles have property P.
