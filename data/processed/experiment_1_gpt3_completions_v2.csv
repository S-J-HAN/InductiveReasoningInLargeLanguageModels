The questions you'll see don't have right or wrong answers, and you are willing to use your best judgment and commit to a concrete, specific response even in cases where you can't be sure that you are correct.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:

Claim - All mammals have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Bats have property P.
Fact - Squirrels have property P.
Claim - All animals have property P.

Question: Assuming all the facts given are true, which argument makes a stronger case for the claim? To get the best answer, first write down your reasoning. Then, based on this, indicate your preference by providing one of the following options:

Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:
Fact - Blackbirds have property P.
Fact - Seagulls have property P.
Fact - Wasps have property P.
Claim - All birds have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Blackbirds have property P.
Fact - Seagulls have property P.
Claim - All birds have property P.

Question: Assuming all the facts given are true, which argument makes a stronger case for the claim? To get the best answer, first write down your reasoning. Then, based on this, indicate your preference by providing one of the following options:
A - Argument A is much more likely
B - Argument A is more likely
C - Argument A is slightly more likely
D - Argument B is slightly more likely
E - Argument B is more likely
F - Argument B is much more likely

The questions you'll see don't have right or wrong answers, and you are willing to use your best judgment and commit to a concrete, specific response even in cases where you can't be sure that you are correct.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:
Fact - Hamsters have property P.
Claim - Cats have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Cats have property P.
Claim - Hamsters have property P.

Question: Assuming all the facts given are true, which argument makes a stronger case for the claim? To get the best answer, first write down your reasoning. Then, based on this, indicate your preference by providing one of the following options:

Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:
Fact - Bats have property P.
Claim - All mammals have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Cows have property P.
Claim - All mammals have property P.

Question: Assuming all the facts given are true, which argument makes a stronger case for the claim? To get the best answer, first write down your reasoning. Then, based on this, indicate your preference by providing one of the following options:
A - Argument A is much more likely
B - Argument A is more likely
C - Argument A is slightly more likely
D - Argument B is slightly more likely
E - Argument B is more likely
F - Argument B is much more likely

The questions you'll see don't have right or wrong answers, and you are willing to use your best judgment and commit to a concrete, specific response even in cases where you can't be sure that you are correct.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim.

Argument A:
Fact - Ostriches have property P.
Claim - All birds have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Doves have property P.
Claim - All birds have property P.

Question: Assuming all the facts given are true, which argument makes a stronger case for the claim? To get the best answer, first write down your reasoning. Then, based on this, indicate your preference by providing one of the following options:

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument B:
Fact - Hamsters have property P.

The questions you'll see don't have right or wrong answers, and you are willing to use your best judgment and commit to a concrete, specific response even in cases where you can't be sure that you are correct.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:

The questions you'll see don't have right or wrong answers, and you are willing to use your best judgment and commit to a concrete, specific response even in cases where you can't be sure that you are correct.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:

Fact - Iguanas have property P.
Claim - All mammals have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Horses have property P.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:
Fact - Llamas have property P.
Fact - Hedgehogs have property P.
Claim - Dogs have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Llamas have property P.
Fact - Cows have property P.
Claim - Dogs have property P.

Question: Assuming all the facts given are true, which argument makes a stronger case for the claim? To get the best answer, first write down your reasoning. Then, based on this, indicate your preference by providing one of the following options:

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:

Claim - All mammals have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Mice have property P.
Fact - Kangaroos have property P.

The questions you'll see don't have right or wrong answers, and you are willing to use your best judgment and commit to a concrete, specific response even in cases where you can't be sure that you are correct.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim.

Argument A:
Fact - Mopeds have property P.
Claim - Motorbikes have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Mopeds have property P.
Claim - Screwdrivers have property P.

Question: Assuming all the facts given are true, which argument makes a stronger case for the claim? To get the best answer, first write down your reasoning. Then, based on this, indicate your preference by providing one of the following options:

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:

Claim - All animals have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Penguins have property P.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:

Claim - Cows have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Pigs have property P.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim.

Argument A:
Fact - Rhinos have property P.
Fact - Llamas have property P.
Fact - Bats have property P.
Claim - Sheep have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Rhinos have property P.

The questions you'll see don't have right or wrong answers, and you are willing to use your best judgment and commit to a concrete, specific response even in cases where you can't be sure that you are correct.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:
Fact - Roosters have property P.
Fact - Storks have property P.
Claim - Crows have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Roosters have property P.
Fact - Peacocks have property P.

Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:
Fact - Roosters have property P.
Claim - Sparrows have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Sparrows have property P.
Claim - Roosters have property P.

Question: Assuming all the facts given are true, which argument makes a stronger case for the claim? To get the best answer, first write down your reasoning. Then, based on this, indicate your preference by providing one of the following options:
A - Argument A is much more likely
B - Argument A is more likely
C - Argument A is slightly more likely
D - Argument B is slightly more likely
E - Argument B is more likely
F - Argument B is much more likely

Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:
Fact - Swallows have property P.
Claim - Turkeys have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Turkeys have property P.
Claim - Swallows have property P.

Question: Assuming all the facts given are true, which argument makes a stronger case for the claim? To get the best answer, first write down your reasoning. Then, based on this, indicate your preference by providing one of the following options:
A - Argument A is much more likely
B - Argument A is more likely
C - Argument A is slightly more likely
D - Argument B is slightly more likely
E - Argument B is more likely
F - Argument B is much more likely

The questions you'll see don't have right or wrong answers, and you are willing to use your best judgment and commit to a concrete, specific response even in cases where you can't be sure that you are correct.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:
Fact - Trams have property P.
Claim - Cars have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Trams have property P.
Fact - Crowbars have property P.
Claim - Cars have property P.

Question: Assuming all the facts given are true, which argument makes a stronger case for the claim? To get the best answer, first write down your reasoning. Then, based on this, indicate your preference by providing one of the following options:

The questions you'll see don't have right or wrong answers, and you are willing to use your best judgment and commit to a concrete, specific response even in cases where you can't be sure that you are correct.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A:
Fact - Zeppelins have property P.
Fact - Tractors have property P.
Claim - All vehicles have property P.

Argument B:
Fact - Zeppelins have property P.
Fact - Tractors have property P.
Fact - Levels have property P.
Claim - All vehicles have property P.

Question: Assuming all the facts given are true, which argument makes a stronger case for the claim? To get the best answer, first write down your reasoning. Then, based on this, indicate your preference by providing one of the following options:
A - Argument A is much more likely
B - Argument A is more likely
C - Argument A is slightly more likely
D - Argument B is slightly more likely
E - Argument B is more likely
F - Argument B is much more likely
