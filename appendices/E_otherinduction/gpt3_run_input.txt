The doctors took a raccoon and shaved away some of its fur. They dyed what was left all black. Then they bleached a single stripe all white down the center of its back. Then, with surgery, they put in its body a sac of super smelly odor, just like a skunk has. When they were done, the animal looked just like a skunk. After the operation was this a skunk or a raccoon?
