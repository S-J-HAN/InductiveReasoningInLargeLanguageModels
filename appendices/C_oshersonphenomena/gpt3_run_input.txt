You are an expert on animals and the types of real world properties that they have. The questions you'll see don't have right or wrong answers, and you are willing to use your best judgment and commit to a concrete, specific response even in cases where you can't be sure that you are correct.

We are interested in how people evaluate arguments. On each trial there will be two arguments labeled 'A' and 'B.' Each will contain one, two, or three statements separated from a claim by a line. Assume that the statements above the line are facts, and choose the argument whose facts provide a better reason for believing the claim. These are subjective judgments; there are no right or wrong answers.

Argument A: 
Fact - Robins have property P.
Fact - Bluejays have property P.
Claim - Sparrows have property P.

Argument B: 
Fact - Robins have property P.
Fact - Bluejays have property P.
Claim - Geese have property P.

Question: Assuming all the facts given are true, which argument makes a stronger case for the claim? To get the best answer, first write down your reasoning. Then, based on this, indicate your preference by providing one of the following options:
A - Argument A is much stronger
B - Argument A is moderately stronger
C - Argument A is slightly stronger
D - Argument B is slightly stronger
E - Argument B is moderately stronger
F - Argument B is much stronger
