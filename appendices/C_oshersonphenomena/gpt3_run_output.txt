My Answer: B - Argument A is moderately stronger. 
Reasoning: Argument A provides two facts that support the claim that sparrows have property P, which is more evidence than Argument B provides for the claim that geese have property P. Therefore, Argument A makes a moderately stronger case for the claim.

C - Argument A is slightly stronger. 

The fact that robins have property P provides some evidence that all birds have property P, but the fact that penguins have property P provides stronger evidence that all birds have property P. Therefore, Argument B makes a slightly stronger case for the claim than Argument A.

Answer: B - Argument A is moderately stronger. 
Reasoning: Argument A makes a stronger case for the claim because it is more specific and limited in scope. It states that all birds have property P, which is supported by the facts given. Argument B states that all animals have property P, which is not supported by the facts given since only birds have been mentioned. Therefore, Argument A is moderately stronger.
****************

Answer: B - Argument A is moderately stronger.

Answer: B - Argument A is moderately stronger.

****************

Answer: B - Argument A is moderately stronger.
Reasoning: Argument A provides one fact that supports the claim that bees have property P, while Argument B provides two facts that support the claim. Therefore, Argument B makes a stronger case for the claim that bees have property P.
****************

Answer: F - Argument B is much stronger. The fact given in Argument B directly supports the claim, while the fact given in Argument A does not. Therefore, Argument B makes a much stronger case for the claim than Argument A.
****************

Answer: B - Argument A is moderately stronger.
Reasoning: Argument A makes a stronger case for the claim because it states that all birds have property P, which is supported by the fact that robins have property P. Argument B states that ostriches have property P, but does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Therefore, Argument A is moderately stronger.
