My reasoning: Robins, Bluejays, and Sparrows are all small birds that belong to the passerine order. Geese, on the other hand, are larger birds that belong to the Anseriformes order. Since the facts provided in both arguments are the same, we can assume that property P might be more likely to be shared among birds that are more closely related.

Based on this reasoning, I would choose option B - Argument A is moderately stronger.
****************
Reasoning: Robins are more representative of the typical bird, as they can fly and have many features that are commonly associated with birds. Penguins, on the other hand, are flightless and have some unique features that set them apart from other birds. Therefore, if a property is found in robins, it is more likely to be found in other birds as well, compared to if the property is found in penguins.

Based on this reasoning, I would choose option B - Argument A is moderately stronger.
****************
My reasoning: Both arguments are based on the same facts, which are that Bluejays and Falcons have property P. Bluejays and Falcons are both types of birds, so it is more reasonable to generalize the property P to all birds rather than all animals. Generalizing to all animals would require more diverse examples of animals having property P.

Based on this reasoning, I would choose option B - Argument A is moderately stronger.
****************
My reasoning: Argument A provides three examples of birds with property P, while Argument B provides only two examples. Having more examples of birds with property P strengthens the case for the claim that all birds have property P.

Based on this reasoning, I would choose option B - Argument A is moderately stronger.
****************
My reasoning: Argument A provides more evidence for the claim by including an additional animal (foxes) that has property P. This additional evidence strengthens the argument by showing that property P is more widespread among animals, making it more likely that gorillas might also have property P.

Based on this reasoning, I would choose option B - Argument A is moderately stronger.
****************
Reasoning: Argument A provides evidence that both a large aquatic mammal (hippo) and a small terrestrial mammal (hamster) have property P. Argument B provides evidence that two large, semi-aquatic mammals (hippo and rhino) have property P. Since Argument A includes a wider range of mammals in terms of size and habitat, it provides a slightly better case for the claim that all mammals have property P.

Answer: C - Argument A is slightly stronger
****************
Reasoning: In Argument A, we have two animals with property P - lions and giraffes. Lions are carnivorous mammals, while giraffes are herbivorous mammals. In Argument B, we have lions and tigers with property P, both of which are carnivorous mammals. Since rabbits are herbivorous mammals, they share a more similar trait with giraffes than with lions or tigers. Therefore, the presence of an herbivorous mammal (giraffe) in Argument A makes it slightly more likely that rabbits might also have property P.

Answer: C - Argument A is slightly stronger
****************
My reasoning: Both arguments A and B have the same claim that all birds have property P. Argument A provides two examples of birds (crows and peacocks) having property P, while Argument B provides the same two examples of birds plus an additional example of a non-bird (rabbits) having property P. The inclusion of rabbits in Argument B does not strengthen the claim about birds, as rabbits are not birds. Therefore, the additional fact in Argument B does not contribute to the claim about birds.

Based on this reasoning, I would choose option C - Argument A is slightly stronger. This is because both arguments have the same bird examples, but Argument B includes an irrelevant fact about rabbits that does not contribute to the claim about birds.
****************
Reasoning: Argument A only provides one example of an animal (flies) having property P. Argument B, on the other hand, provides two examples of animals (flies and orangutans) having property P. Although neither flies nor orangutans are closely related to bees, the fact that two different animals have property P makes it more likely that bees might also have property P.

Based on this reasoning, my preference is:
E - Argument B is moderately stronger
****************
My reasoning: Mice and bats are both mammals, but they belong to different orders (Rodentia and Chiroptera, respectively). While they share some common features, they also have many differences. In this case, it is not clear what property P is, so it is difficult to determine how likely it is that one species having property P would imply the other species also has it.

However, bats are more closely related to other mammals like primates and carnivores than they are to rodents like mice. This means that if a property is found in bats, it might be more likely to be found in other mammals, including mice. On the other hand, if a property is found in mice, it might be less likely to be found in more distantly related mammals like bats.

Based on this reasoning, I would choose option E - Argument B is moderately stronger.
****************
Reasoning: Argument A makes a general claim about all birds, while Argument B makes a specific claim about ostriches. Since robins and ostriches are both birds, knowing that robins have property P provides some evidence that ostriches might also have property P. However, it does not provide strong evidence that all birds have property P, as there are many different types of birds with varying properties.

Based on this reasoning, I would choose option D - Argument B is slightly stronger.
