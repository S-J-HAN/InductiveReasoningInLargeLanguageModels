No, this is not a coffeepot anymore. It has been modified so much that it is now a bird feeder. The handle has been sawed off, the top knob has been removed, the spout has been sealed closed, the base has been sawed off, and a flat piece of metal has been attached. A stick has been attached and a window has been cut in it, and it has been filled with bird food. All of these modifications have changed the object from a coffeepot to a bird feeder.
